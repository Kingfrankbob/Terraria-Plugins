## Capture The Gem
Some notes to think of
- I used PascalCase for everything except local functions because I know those are camelCase.
- I did my best to seperate everything into classes, and keep them doing what they are suppose to be doing
- Im hoping that each function serves one or two purposes max!
## HideNSeek
I just made the code look neater!
## Test Plugin
Fixed, sort of like the ctg, but I kept my old ways for legacy
## Give Group Buff
I made it for a spanish friend, I made it a switch case instead of all if statements!
